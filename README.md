## Philosophy

**Q**: Why not to use any email marketing automation platform?

**A**: Drag and click?  Come on, we're engineers, there is a better way.  Limited features for editing?  They are, but we don't.  We offer free, open source software, with maximum flexibility for customization.

**Q**: Why do I name my custom markup language as `.slm`?

**A**: SLM (aka the English word ***slim***) = **S**uper **L**ightweight **M**arkup.  Isn't it sexy?  ü§ì  And for the tag delimiter, I've chosen `‚á•‚á§`, which is rarely used in text content, it means slim as well, just imagine: `‚á•)(‚á§` it's so vivid!

## Setup

* Run `bundle install` to install all necessary dependencies

## HOWTO

Literally, there is no easier way than this one.

* Prepare your `[source].slm`

  - In custom markup language

  - No nonsense content (I mean HTML tags, CSS styles and etc.)

  - Indentation: 2 spaces (if you use tabs, alright, but it will be normalized to spaces anyway)

  - Please refer to [this example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thyrlian/TechNewsletter/master/example.slm)

* Add your own or modify existing HTML fragment inside [`templates` directory](https://github.com/thyrlian/TechNewsletter/tree/master/templates)

* Add or modify corresponding `print_*` private method in [`Factory` class](https://github.com/thyrlian/TechNewsletter/blob/master/lib/newsletter/factory.rb).  Including two major behavior:

  - Parsing the tree data structure from the custom markup language (`.slm`)

  - Rendering HTML fragment

* Run code to compile `.slm` to a fabulous HTML page

## Test

To run unit test: `rake test`

## Compatibility

* **External CSS**: When you host the CSS file on GitHub (not [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)), even if you specify `type="text/css"`, GitHub will respond the CSS file with MIME type `text/plain`, and your browser won't be able to render the CSS.

  - Chrome: `Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB) blocked cross-origin response with MIME type text/plain.`

  - Firefox: `The resource was blocked due to MIME type (‚Äútext/plain‚Äù) mismatch (X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff).`

  - Safari: `Did not parse stylesheet because non CSS MIME types are not allowed when 'X-Content-Type: nosniff' is given.`

  - Workaround: Route the CSS file hosted on GitHub via a free open source CDN such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh), which will eventually respond it with the proper MIME type text/css.  Just like this: `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/.../YOUR.CSS" />`

* **Inline CSS** can not be rendered properly in some email clients.
